			<div>Light Frigate</div>
		</div>

		<p>
Frigates are the first ships you'll get. There are four main types of frigates. The first is pictured above, the light frigate. These are useful before you have anything else, in some missions and when you want to lend transports to allies. Otherwise, they're pretty useless. <br> 

<br>The next type is the basic tech frigate.<br> They're useful in early missions and as a meatshield later on.

<br>The next type is the anti-minor frigate. <br> Their usefulness is directly proportional to the power of minor ships; strong minor ships means minors are a common threat means anti-minor frigates are useful. Weak minor ships means no one uses minors on offense and thus these are useless.

<br>The last type of frigate is the boarding ship. Long overlooked, these became a staple in AD2460 when Honorverse built a very successful bank defense fleet around them. Against corv spam, boarding ships can slow down the enemy corv line and pop out ghosts. Against cruiser fleets targeting most speed or least hull, they make excellent flak due to their high dodge. Against low-strength battleships fleets and cruiser fleets targeting firepower, they can wreak havoc on enemy capital ships. The boarding ship is incredibly useful, and deserves a spot in almost every late-game fleet.

			<div>Spearhead, the InTech basic cruiser</div>
		</div>

		<p>
There are two types of cruisers, basic cruisers and special cruisers. I'll address basic cruisers here; special cruisers will be addressed later.<br><br>Basic cruisers are the second type of capital ship you'll unlock. They have good firepower, decent hull, and are often make up the bulk of a fleet, especially at higher strengths (100k+). They take up 2,000 strength.
		</p>

		<h4 id="Carriers">Carriers</h4>

		<div class="image">
			<img src="http://www.outposthunter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/carrier-heron.jpg" alt="Heron" style="width:500px;height:250px;">
			<div>Heron, the StronTech carrier</div>
		</div>

		<p>
Carriers have amazing hull, and almost nonexistent firepower. As the name suggests, their primary purpose is to carry minor ships into combat. They are a critical part of a once-popular strategy, corv spam, and are good if you need some low-strength hangar slots. However, high strength cruiser fleets generally have enough hangar slots without carriers. They take up 1,000 strength.
		</p>

		<h4 id="Battleships">Battleships</h4>
		
		<div class="image">

			<div>Beacon, the NeoTech Battleship</div>
		</div>

		<p>
Battleships are the last ships you'll unlock. Even a single battleship can turn the tides of battle at low strength (under 50k). At higher strength, they mostly exist to flak for cruisers and provide fleet boosts. They have good hull or shields (depending on tech) and decent firepower. They take up 10,000 strength.

		<h5>Cannons</h5>
		<h5>Shieldboosters</h5>
		<h5>Artillery</h5>
		<h5>Stations</h5>

		<div id="in">
			<h3>InTech Ships</h3>

			<h5>Hammerhead</h5>

			<p>
The Hammerhead is a special frigate that is 650 strength. It has no primary weapon at all, instead focusing on a barrage of low-damage missiles meant to overwhelm opposing missile defense. It works well in missile-spam fleets alongside the adamant (next ship). The long range on its missiles allows it to fire immediately (as opposed to moving forwards, as most frigates have to), giving it an edge over opposing frigates.
			</p>

			<h5>Adamant</h5>

			<p>
The Adamant is a special cruiser that takes up 2500 strength. It's been changed a ton this round, so I haven't got a whole lot to say about it yet.
			</p>
			<h5>Omega</h5>

			<p>
The Omega is a special battleship that is 8,000 strength that focuses on taking out frigates and minors ships. It has a number of weaker primary shots with better aim than other battleship primary guns, making it well suited to taking out a number of frigates on any given turn.<br>

<br>However, it has significantly less hull than the warden, and no shields. It also has low range, which can be a blessing (so it targets frigates, which it is built for, rather than battleships) and a curse (because its range is low enough that it often has to move up, especially if you haven't invested in the battleship range tech tile). In general, no BS range points = target frigates, 3 BS range points = target cruisers, and 5 BS range points = target battleships.
			</p>
		</div>
	
		<div id="stron">
			<h3>StronTech Ships</h3>

			<h5>Scythe</h5>

			<p>
The Scythe is a special frigate, and is 650 strength. It has a single strong primary weapon and operates best in walls, alongside a lot of other scythes, in larger fleets. They are considered an anti-cruiser frigate, as their aim is not good enough to hit frigates reliably.
			</p>

			<h5>Protector</h5>

			<p>
The Protector is a very useful support ship. It is a special cruiser that is 2,500 strength, and it can EMP up to 50 minor ships per turn. It can also shoot down some missiles that are aimed at it, and can transfer its shields to friendly ships. Of all the ships you can post for alliance use, this is the most useful one, without question.<br>

<br>It has high shields, but very low hull. It is also quite fast for a cruiser, so it is vulnerable to "most speed" targeting. Additionally, its primary range is rather low, so it tends to move farther forwards than the rest of the cruisers.
			</p>

			<h5>The Volker</h5>

			<p>
The Volker is a very powerful special cruiser, and is the background image you're looking at right now. It is 2,500 strength, like the Protector. It has a strong primary weapon that also strips shields, making it especially devastating to StronTech battleships, protectors and other volkers. In combination with Devastation, the StronTech commander ability, Volker-based fleets often win by triggering unwinnable early on. It also has missiles, but no tertiary firepower at all. It has even less hull than the Protector and has really piss-poor aim, meaning it is best suited to taking on battleships and cruisers (which have low dodge), rather than frigates or minor ships.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div id="neo">
			<h3>NeoTech Ships</h3>

			<h5>Ghost</h5>

			<p>
The ghost is a special corvette. It is 265 strength rather than 225, and is cloaked until it fires its first missile. This means that it cannot be targeted until it opens fire, making it very dangerous. They are especially powerful on homeworld defense, where you don't retreat when you run out of caps.<br>

<br>However, it is also rather frail and has very low range. This makes it less suited to large fights, where they will be shredded by enemy tertiary guns. They also move more slowly when cloaked. This means that they pass through the middle of the battlefield, where the minor-to-minor battle takes place, after everything else, so they do not contribute in that sense.
			</p>

			<h5>Defender</h5>

			<p>
The defender is a special cruiser, and is 2,500 strength. It attracts missiles and can turn up to 15 of those missiles back to the enemy. The firepower is mostly in secondary missiles, and overall they have higher firepower than the infinite. It is worth noting that this means that they will be targeted before the infinite. The range is long enough to hit battleships when targeting firepower, for better or for worse. <br>Thanks to Zelos for the information in this section.
			</p>

			<h5>Gravity Well</h5>

			<p>
The gravity well is a special battleship, and is the background you're looking at right now. They are 10,000 strength, and are very hit-and-miss, and I'm going to prioritize other parts of this guide right now. From Zelos: "Use in moderation, in large fleets only."
